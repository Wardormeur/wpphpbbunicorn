The goal of this Wordpress plugin is to allow the communication in the wordpress to phpbb way.
it's the opposite of phpbbwpunicorn plugin, made for phpbb.
Each plugin register to its own event, no more "hacky all-in-one" plugin that get unstable /unsycnrhonized

Required : Wordpress (tested 4.1) 
Phpbb 3.1+ 

Help/Remarks/Evolutions are up to what you may think of. Be creative and don't restrain yourslef about how i could improve the plugin (aka you code like a pig)

I may refuse some : this plugin only treats data from Wordpress TO phpbb, and not the opposite. The phpbb plugin is phpbbwpunicorn

Credits for inspiration : merianos from e-xtnd.it for the original wp-phpbb-bridge i've used until phpbb3.1
Anytime for a beer dude
AND nikic for his PHP-Parser that allows me to make some proxy version of the classes (cause no namespaces are used, so that they conflict :))
